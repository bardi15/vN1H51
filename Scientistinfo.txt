Charles Babbage;1;1791;1871;English polymath.[1] A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage is best remembered for originating the concept of a programmable computer.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage
Ada Lovelace;0;1815;1852;British mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace
Alan Turing;1;1912;1954;British pioneering computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing
Grace Murray Hopper;0;1906;1992;American computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral.[1] She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944,[2] invented the first compiler for a computer programming language;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper
John Vincent Atanasoff;1;1903;1995;Bulgarian-American physicist and inventor. Best known for building the first electronic digital computer, the Aanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC), though it was neither programmable nor Turing-complete.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vincent_Atanasoff
George Boole;1;1815;1864;English mathematician, educator, philosopher and logician. Chiefly known for formalizing Boolean algebra, the basis for digital logic and computer science.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole
Timothy John Berners-Lee;1;1955;0;English computer scientist. Best known as the inventor of the world wide web alongside Robert Cailliau, he was the first to send HTTP communication between client and server.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee
Blaise Pascal;1;1623;1662;French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Christian philosopher. Known for inventing the mechanical calculator.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal
Saul Rosen;1;1922;1991;American computer science pioneer. Chiefly known for designing the software of the first transistor-based computer.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Rosen
Margeret Heafield Hamilton;0;1936;0;Computer scientist, system engineer and buisiness owner. She is credited with coining the phrase "Software engineering" and developed the concepts of asynchronous software, priority scheduling, end-to-end testing, and human-in-the-loop decision capability, such as priority displays which then became the foundation for ultra reliable software design.;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)
